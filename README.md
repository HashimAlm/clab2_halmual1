Activity 2 has been completed with this commit:
It adds the refactored Act2VehicleService and Act2Main

Activity 3 completed:
Adds vehicle co2Emissions feature with 3 emission reduction strategies
Has Act3Main and Act3VehicleService to handle new changes

The Strategy pattern seems better as it offers the runtime object dynamism with an easier code implementation. No need to specify object type everywhere multiple times.
Vistor can be good in scenarios of increasing and unplanned dependacies wherein features can be added without much dependancy worry affecting the classes/objects.
